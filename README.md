# DTSA5511 Monet

Use GANs to create art with [data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started).

Contains a notebook, a finalized submission csv to submit to kaggle for a score, and a screenshot of the kaggle scores.

This notebook doesn't include the code to submit the artifact to kaggle since that needed to be done in a notebook hosted on kaggle.
